## Course Outline

### Module 1

#### Summary

#### Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Define each word in the FAIR acronym: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
2. Summarize the steps of FAIR data collection, management, and deposition.
3. Identify the various ways data presents itself and the properties of each type.
    a. Structured data
         i. systems (relational databases, blockchain)
        ii. repetitive (sensor output, metered data)
    b. Unstructured data
         i. text (emails, transcriptions, literary texts, social media) 
        ii. non-textual (images, video, audio)
4. Discuss the relationship between a research question, a dataset, and the AI methods.

Sorry about my late response. I have gone through the slides and would like to give some ideas for these coming workshops.

1. I think we have talked about to including agriculture applications for the audience from USDA. Typical AI applications in agriculture could be found in UF/IFAS and presented to rephrase the concepts of algorithms and data types. 
    a. The challenges encountered in these projects could be a good side topic to be included in the workshops since many
       difficulties, such as data preparation, feature selection, model tuning, etc., are common for AI applications.
       
2. The current content looks mainly developed for AI developers or engineers. But I could imagine the people from USDA would be also interested in the social impact of AI in agriculture. Since farmers are mainly users and models are the services provided by related companies, the ethics issues regarding this collaboration (e.g., data ownership, profit/data sharing) could be also an interesting part for them besides the ethics in decision making (e.g., data bias).

3. Data type and management would be an important part as all AI models are running by feeding data. It would be necessary to give a summary of the types of data collected from agriculture systems and their management.
