### Module 1

#### Summary

#### Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Recall and define each word of FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
2. Summarize the steps of FAIR data collection, management, and deposition.
3. Identify the various ways data presents itself and the properties of each type.
    a. Structured data
         i. systems (relational databases, blockchain)
        ii. repetitive (sensor output, metered data)
    b. Unstructured data
         i. text (emails, transcriptions, literary texts, social media) 
        ii. non-textual (images, video, audio)
4. Correctly match foundational data terms to their definitions.
5. Discuss the relationship between a research question, a dataset, and available AI methods.
